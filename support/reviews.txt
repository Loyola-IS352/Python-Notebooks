Review 1: A great phone all around!
Cinder's review of <a href="/site/apple-iphone-xs-64gb-space-gray-verizon/6009860.p?skuId=6009860">Apple - iPhone XS 64GB - Space Gray (Verizon)</a>: 
I held on to my iPhone 6s as long as I could but the battery life was beginning to fade quickly so I finally decided 
to upgrade to the Xs. This phone is so fun and easy to use! I thought not having a home button would make it harder 
to control but everything is very smooth and easily accessible. The facial recognition is great and very smart, the 
camera is clear and takes great pictures, and the speaker has nice volume and great quality sound. The phone is also 
more durable than any other phone I've had and I finally feel comfortable using a light case with no screen protector 
instead of an otter box. I also love how long the battery lasts! I can use my phone all day long and still have about 
30-40% at the end of the day.

Review 2: I'm Happy to Be Back
glassandout87's review of <a href="/site/apple-iphone-xs-64gb-space-gray-verizon/6009860.p?skuId=6009860">Apple - iPhone XS 64GB - Space Gray (Verizon)</a>:
I should have never left Apple for Samsung. After years of Android, the whole Note and S Pen thing really looses it's 
allure and is more of a novelty. I was quickly reminded how well Apple streamlines all the aspects of the phone, apps, 
contacts, settings, email, etc. I can go on. The battery life is great. I left the house at 4am yesterday, came back at 
6pm, still had 36% left. The glass backing feels sturdy, and the processor is really fast, especially noticeable on my 
Arlo app, which lagged on my Note 8.

Review 3: The Apple iPhone XS is a really nice phone.
Baker's review of <a href="/site/apple-iphone-xs-64gb-space-gray-verizon/6009860.p?skuId=6009860">Apple - iPhone XS 64GB - Space Gray (Verizon)</a>:
I purchased the Apple iPhone XS for my daughter to replace her iPhone 5. She and her husband have invested themselves 
in Apple products. I personally do not like Apple because of thier proprietary systems and lack of interoperability 
with android or Microsoft products. I also believe that Apple charges way too much for their proprietary products. 
However, as far as the iPhone XS goes, it is a really nice smartphone, like most all Apple products are. My daughter 
likes her new iPhone XS and its interoperability with all of her and her husband's Apple products.

Review 4: Coming from a 7 Plus
Jerry's review of <a href="site/apple-iphone-xs-64gb-gold-verizon/6009862.p?skuId=6009862">Apple - iPhone XS 64GB - Gold (Verizon)</a>:
My only regret would be that I did not get the XS Max (I couldn't justify the extra $100). While the screen of the 
XS is bigger than that of a Plus, the screen is actually just longer and narrower, therefore when playing certain apps 
in landscape mode, the screen is even smaller than the Plus because there is a black border on the bottom of the screen 
to show the swipe up to home gesture. Other than that, the camera is great and the gestures make me not miss the home 
button at all.

Review 5: Connective issues
John9's review of <a href="site/apple-iphone-xs-64gb-gold-verizon/6009862.p?skuId=6009862">Apple - iPhone XS 64GB - Gold (Verizon)</a>: 
The phone is great except that it either has slow or no connection. Apps constantly open to the no connection screen. 
I'm on Verizon and have never experienced this before. I'm putting my SIM card back in my pixel 2. I thought I was 
paying for 40 percent better connection speeds, instead this is by far the slowest connection on any phone I've used 
in years. Other than waiting a minute for websites to download, hello 2009, it's a beautiful piece of tech.

Review 6: Smaller but Better
GuillouK's review of <a href="/site/apple-iphone-xs-64gb-space-gray-verizon/6009860.p?skuId=6009860">Apple - iPhone XS 64GB - Space Gray (Verizon)</a>: 
I always loved Apple for its clean and slick looks. Upgrading from the iPhone 7 Plus to this phone was a great move 
for me. The specs overall are better and what really made me switch was the Dual SIM. Traveling a lot and now being 
able to use one phone and add in an EU sim will really make everything more convenient. I'm still getting used to 
the no home button and facial recognition, but overall I'm happy with the upgrade.

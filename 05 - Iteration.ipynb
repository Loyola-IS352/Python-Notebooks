Up to this point, we’ve been limited to simple tasks, and if we needed to perform the task more than once, we needed to run the application again. In this chapter, we will learn about iteration, the most powerful capability of any programming language.\n\nConsider the following blocks of code. Both produce the same output, but they rely on different logics to achieve this outcome. The first block of code can be interpreted as \"Do this, then this and finally this.\" When we look at the output, it is clear it is doing the same thing three times, but the code suggests that these are three independent commands."

This will allow you to organize portions of your code as loops and will make your code more efficient and easier to read. \n\n## Iterator\nOften, when we loop through some segment of code, we only want to perform the actions a set number of time. Programming languages do not have built-in ways of keeping track of how many times the code has looped, so we need to create a variable that keeps track for us. This variable is called the iterator. The easiest way to understand this variable is as a counter that we update every time the code loops. To update a variable, we simply create an assignment statement which sets our counter equal the current value of the counter plus one.\n\nConsider the following code. In the first statement, the counter (varCounter) is initialized (oftentimes as zero or one)."

Though both loops can often be used interchangeably, the logic for the task you are performing often determines the appropriate type of loop. If you need a loop that will execute code until some state of the application changes (e.g., you are searching a data file for a specific value), you should use a while loop. If you want to loop a known number of iterations (e.g., you wan to perform some action to every record in a data file), you should use a for loop. The following code loops five times, like the code above, but the logic of the loop is a bit different. In this loop, it loops through each number in a list of numbers—the list of numbers just happens to be five numbers long (note: the range() function creates a list of numbers that starts with the first parameter and includes every number up to the second parameter. A third parameter can be used to indicate steps in the range)."

Sometimes you will write one by accident and other times you will write one because you don’t quite know how long your loop needs to run. Infinite loops can be useful but they are also dangerous. To write an infinite loop, you simply need to use the keyword True as the condition for a while loop. Because while loops run while the condition is true, a True condition will never be false and the loop will never end. You should write at least one infinite loop if only to familiarize yourself with the break feature on PyCharm. If you are writing an intentional infinite loop, you will need to include a conditional statement which breaks the loop at some specified time—either when the task is done or when you reach some certain point of execution. Break is a keyword which tells Python to exit the current block of code."
